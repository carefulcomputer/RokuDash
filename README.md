# RokuDash

Control your Roku TV with spare amazon dash buttons. This code will listen for udp packets from dash buttons and send commands to your roku TV.
Current code has two examples, one turns on/off TV, and second turns on the TV and switches a particular channel.

Pre-requisites -
*You should know mac addresses of your Dash buttons
*You should know mac address and IP of your roku TV

plug those values in script and run script as root on you machine (root needed to listen to UDP packets).
